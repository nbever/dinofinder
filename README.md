A ReactJS mashup for ancient life information

This is an application to help explore ancient life through mashing up information from both paleodb.org and eol.org.  
Basically the application allows you to traverse the caldogram of species from any point (and manipulate the tree
for better viewing), and to dig into information and media known about whichever node you're interested in.

It also allows you to see where fossils have been discovered for a particular species and soon will allow you to 
look in depth at a specific region of the world to see what lived there throughout time.
